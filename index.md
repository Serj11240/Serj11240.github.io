### Autoencoder with Tensorflow 

In this project I tried to create my own artificially generated images using Keras and Autoencoder technique.
Playing aroung with hyperparameters and architecture. Struggling a lot with computational possibilities of my machine and Colab.
Initial idea was to create watercolour "filter" for images. Model was trained on dataset of images took from Flickr using their API. 
Below there is some outputs for given image:
![Input Image](/images/input.jpgg "Input")
<img src="images/input.jpg?raw=true"/>
[View project on GitHub](https://github.com/Serj11240/autoencoder) - current version is with cats images.

### Author detection with Scrapping

Based on articles of selected authors scrapped from *money.pl* webpage, I checked few approaches on author detecting. Strating from basic logic and custom built function to classify author based on language similarity, logistic regression and Multinomial Naive-Bayes. Data preprocessing and language analysis done with Spacy library for Python.
